# pop-task-demo
DEMO VERSION

Hi!

Pop Task can be used to manage daily tasks and track time with a minimum of distraction. It was created using React, Express, and Mongoose. 

The main screen is for tasks that you are working on today. To start a new task, enter details as desired and click "blow bubble". Once you have a bubble, you can edit or delete, or start timing your progress on the given task.

Once finished, click "pop" to complete a task. You can click "Popped" to view a record of all completed tasks. To take note of a task to be completed another day, click "Backlog" to go to the backlog screen. Bubbles in the backlog can be moved to the Current screen manually, or they can move automatically if you select a due date.

Thanks and enjoy!
